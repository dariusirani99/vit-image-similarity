# General

- This repository is for building the ViT Image Similarity Model.
- It requires the use of Google Cloud Integration with the MAR file generated.
- Please see the "console_scripts" for the scripts to run on the VM and on the Raspberry Pi.

# Training the Models

To train the ViT Model, follow these steps:

1. **Set desired model hyperparameters**

   - Adjust desired training hyperparameters in 'config/train_config.yml', or leave as default.

2. **Run the train_model.py script in a CMD window:**

     ```plaintext
     python train_model.py
     ```

# Generating the MAR file

To generate the MAR file, follow these steps:

1. **Train the model using steps above**

2. **Download the required dependencies to prevent version mismatches**

   - Use the following command to generate the MAR file in a CMD window:
     ```plaintext
     cd vit-similarity-model
     python download_dependencies.py download
     ```

3. **Run the manage.py command**

   - Use the following command to generate the MAR file in a CMD window:
     ```plaintext
     cd vit-similarity-model
     python manage.py build
     ```

# Predicting a Single Image

1. **Train the model using steps above**

2. **Use the predict_model.py script to generate a prediction**

   - Use the following command to predict the output given a single image:
     ```plaintext
     python predict_model.py --model-file {path to model file} --device {cuda or cpu} --input-file {path to input image}
     ```
3. **See the output image and json in the ./output folder**


# Integrating MAR file with Virtual Machine

1. **Transfer the "fetch_compute_images.py" script to a VM instance.**

   - Ensure that Python is running on a virtual environment inside the machine.

2. **Pip download all requirements listed in the requirements.txt file.**

3. **Place fetch_compute_images.py script in a folder known to you on your Virtual Machine.**

4. **Place take_and_upload.py script in a folder known to you on your Raspberry Pi.**

5. **After running the manage.py command, place the "vitsimilaritymodel-0.1.0" in a folder named "torchserve/model-store", with the "torchserve" folder being your main folder for TorchServe.**

6. **Place the "config.properties" file located in `vit-similarity-model/supplemental` in the `torchserve` folder (NOT the `torchserve/model-store` folder).**

7. **Download your Google Cloud Application credentials for your entire project as a JSON file, and place it in a known path on your Virtual Machine AND your Raspberry Pi.**

8. **Edit `fetch_compute_images.py` and `take_and_upload.py` to add your Google Cloud data where the `#TODO` lines are located.**

9. **Ensure your `~/.bashrc` file on your VM has the following lines of code:**

    ```plaintext
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path to your google application credentials json"
    export JAVA_HOME=path to your java bin
    export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

    python3 path to fetch_compute_images.py &

    (
      cd /home/ubuntu/google-cloud/torchserve &&
      torchserve --start --model-store model-store --disable-token-auth
    ) &
    ```

10. **After completing all these steps, run the following command on your Raspberry Pi, connected to a camera:**

    ```plaintext
    python take_and_upload.py
    ```
